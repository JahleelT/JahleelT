# Hi there, Jahleel here! 👋

### What I am Currently Working On

- **Resume Screener:** Flask + React + PostgreSQL + Pinecone + OpenAI/LangChain AI-powered resume screener that utilizes vectorization for similarity analysis of a resume and a job description.


### What I Have Completed

- **TrackAJob:** Java CLI application to track job applications. It utilizes OOP concepts of abstraction and encapsulation, has XML import and exportation, and practices using industry-standard programming such as using Logger instead of syso.
- **PhotographicalDisplay:** JS/HTML/CSS basic application to showcase photos I have taken throughout my travels/adult life. I may continue this further to have the photos be the doorway to themed galleries.
- **ButtonPress:** React + NodeJS + Firebase/Firestore + GCP application that simply counts the number of times a logged-in user has pressed a button. Serves to practice using React and GCP.

#### Group Completions
- **RestaSwipe:** MERN stack application for restaurant discovery in NYC via tinder-style swiping.
- **Resume Screener:** Flask + OpenAI application to give a best fit analysis between a user's resume and a job description.


### What's Next

- **CommuteSmartAI:** React (TS) + Fiber (Go) + Python + OpenAI NYC public transportation application. Think Google Maps, but better and a more intuitive navigational experience!
- **ResNGo:** React Native application for creating reservations
